Database & Schema Setup

Created database: RetailSalesDB

Created schema: RetailSchema

Data Loading

Loaded CSV files using Snowflake Web UI (drag-and-drop)

FROM OrderDetails od
JOIN Products p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID
GROUP BY p.ProductName
ORDER BY TotalSold DESC
LIMIT 10;

üîπ Monthly Sales Revenue
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', o.OrderDate) AS Month,
       SUM(od.TotalAmount) AS Revenue
FROM Orders o
JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
GROUP BY Month
